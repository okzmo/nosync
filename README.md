# NOSYNC

My work, my life, my notes, my memories, nosync exist simply because I wanted to keep all that close by in a simple app with a gorgeous interface that I can expand as much as I want. Keeping that to myself felt like a waste, so here it is. No marketing, no ads, no bullshit. Just you and me trying to build something that brings us joy. Take care.
